This project was designed and tested for [https://www.biquge.co/](https://www.biquge.co/)

## How To Use 

For example, we are trying to download [this](https://www.biquge.co/9_9443/) book. 

* First, we run the program and enter the link as prompted.

* Then a text.txt file will appear within the same folder of the program. 

* Then you can sent the .txt file to your phone using various ways, for ex., discord.
